ESPHome Rename Completed
------------------------

Back in 1.10.0, I decided to rename the project from esphomelib to ESPHome. This release
has seen **massive** refactors to allow this rename. Literally thousands of files had
to be changed, often with lots of manual action required. Now a rename might not seem
too exciting for the user, but consider this: Lots of ancient code got revised and cleaned up,
the ESPHome source got moved to a `dedicated Github Organization <https://github.com/esphome>`__
and many other organizational changes were made which will enable faster feature development.

As an example, ESPHome's documentation now gets built and served by `Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`__,
so all documentation contributions will now get a preview of the changes on a deploy website.

Installation Methods Changed
----------------------------

Because of this rename, ESPHome's installation methods have also changed (breaking change!).

- **Hass.io**: The Hass.io addon repository has moved to `https://github.com/esphome/hassio <https://github.com/esphome/hassio>`__,
  please remove the old addon repository and add the new repository. During beta period, install beta version of addon.

- **pip-based installs**: The new installation command is ``pip2 install esphome`` and
  the ``esphomeyaml`` command now is called ``esphome``. Or ``pip2 install --pre esphome`` during beta period.

- **docker-based installs**: The docker image has moved to ``esphome/esphome``. So now you need
  to use ``docker run --rm -it esphome/esphome livingroom.yaml run``. Or ``docker run --rm -it esphome/esphome:beta ...`` during beta period

All old installation methods will no longer receive updates (and potentially be removed
in the future).
